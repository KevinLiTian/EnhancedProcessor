# Overview
In the second year of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto St.George campus, ECE243 is a course aims for students to learn the connection between software and hardware. This course teaches programming in ARM Assembly, C and Verilog. This project is one of the labs of this course.<br/>

This project implements a custom designed processor written in Verilog. Handles basic ARM Assembly instructions such as load, store, move, move top, add, subtract, and, etc. Verilog code uses FSM (finite state machine) to control the states of the instructions and complete them in 3-5 states.

### Processor Schematic
The basic schematic of the custom processor is shown in the figure below. The processor used units such as registers, multiplexers and ALU, interprete instructions and translate them into hardware signals transmitting between the units to complete the instructions. <br/>

### Memory Schematic
The processor also connects to a memory unit which can store pre-defined instructions. The schematic is shown in the figure below. <br/>

## Contact ME
If you are interested in the source code or the original documentations, please do contact me through my email kevintian.li@mail.utoronto.ca or kevin.li20021106@gmail.com. You have to prove that you are not a current ECE243 student since this will be an academic integrity issue. If you are, try to think and code it yourself as it will be a great practice to improve your skills; though if you have any questions, feel free to share it with me!
